# RPG-engine

Simple, turned-based RPG engine

The map is randomly generated with land, forests, and mountain tiles. Lands have a low enemy encounter rate, forests have a higher encounter rate, and mountains are impassable.

Combat is simple with just attack and run options.

Enemy is animated using CSS Steps with an animation spritesheet, but static images can also be used.

Goal is to reach the yellow tile.

Make the game yours! 

Some suggestions:
- Add an epic story! Princesses and Princes and Dragons and Knights!
- A leveling system? Use that exp system to level up your character!
- More enemies? 
- A big boss!? Evil wizard? Corrupt knight? Angels and demons?
- Towns! Add depth to your world building! Shops! Blacksmiths!
- Battle options? Strengthen the strategic options during battle! Items! Weapon upgrades! Teammates?!
